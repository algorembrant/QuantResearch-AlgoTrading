Thats true in novels, stories, and even in games. But todays Finalcial Market is nothing for that. What you'll be trading is a non-tangible asset which grant automatic ownership to the trader as soon as he/she males a trade with one-click of a button away. Some view the market as scrary environment just by looking charts, its rallies to the upside, staircase-like-0structure, and then eventually drops darply to the downside with a big fat candle. And think someone died. Well, thats true for all, yet lack of context.\n",
